Project Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines

Project Objectives:
- Refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO
- Ensure that all links are functioning correctly
- Clean up the CSS to make it more efficient

What was done:
- HTML Elements were changed to reflect their purpose, i.e header div changed to "header," navigation div changed to "nav"
- CSS and HTML files were given comments to separate each section
- Unnecessary CSS selectors were removed
- In CSS, the "Content Style" and "Benefits Style" were swapped to better reflect the organization of the code in HTML
- Links are fully functioning
- Alt titles were given to non-decorative images
- Combined CSS and changed HTML class names to eliminate copied code
- HTML content div class named "SOS" for "Search, Online, Social"
- HTML benefits div class named "LBC" for "Lead, Brand, Cost"
