Project Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines

Project Objectives:
- Refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO
- Ensure that all links are functioning correctly
- Clean up the CSS to make it more efficient

What was done:
- HTML Elements were changed to reflect their purpose, i.e header div changed to "header," navigation div changed to "nav"
- CSS and HTML files were given comments to separate each section
